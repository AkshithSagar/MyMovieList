## User and Movie Mapping
After creating the users and movies, the next step is to map the user to their respective movie. We created a movies_status table that maintains the unique user ID, the corresponding unique movie ID and the status of that movie for the user (completed, watching, plan to watch, etc). The two IDs act as foreign keys and link the movies_status table to the user table as well as the movie table.

        "status": "Completed"

```
